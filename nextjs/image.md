## 图片优化
1. Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
2. Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
3. Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
4. Serving images in modern formats, like WebP and AVIF, when the browser supports it.
